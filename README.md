This project is to design and implement battery-powered electronic stethoscope with non-invasive functionality. The device provides one output (ADC input) for data transmission and visualization
on a computer. Its compact dimensions (10cm x 4cm for the stethoscope head and 8cm x 6cm x 3cm for the
signal acquisition device) allow for easy handling. The stethoscope delivers clear output voltages ranging from
0 to 5V, with signal frequencies spanning 0-310 Hz. It is equipped with a low pass filter (cut-off at 310 Hz) and
ensures reliable analog-to-digital conversion at a sampling frequency of 1600 Hz. The amplifier achieves a gain
of 735, ensuring precise signal amplification. With a maximum output current of 50 mA.
